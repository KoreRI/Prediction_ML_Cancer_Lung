# Lung_Cancer_Prediction_ML

A complete project for employing different machine learning models to predict lung cancer is available in this repository.
Comparing the performance of individual model is the main objective. 
The dataset comprises several lung cancer-related features that have been preprocessed, standardized, and applied to the training of different classifiers.


The code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization is included in this repository, offering a complete approach for machine learning-based lung cancer prediction.

### Classification Algorithms
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
* XGBoost                           



### Model Evaluation
* Classification Report: Generating detailed classification reports to understand precision, recall, f1-score, and support.
* Confusion Matrix: Visualizing the performance of the ensemble model with a confusion matrix heatmap.

### Model Analysis and Visualization 
Accuracy Comparison: Visualizing and comparing the accuracies of individual models using bar plot.

### Result:
When it came to performance, Logistic Regression was the best algorithm used. The following are the metrics used to evaluate logistic regression:
* Accuracy: 0.94623656
* Precision: 0.94
* Recall:  1.00  
* F1 score:  0.97
